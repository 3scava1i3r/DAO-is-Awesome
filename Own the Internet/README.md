We are proposing a new method to save all the medical records by using a decentralized storage unit and using sia blockchain based skynet portals to access records.With power transfer using our decentralized means we can minimize the attack vector which we were exposed to while using central servers.Our Web-app makes it possible to upload a medical document by the person itself  so that the information is only limited to oneself and not under the rule of a central authority.
